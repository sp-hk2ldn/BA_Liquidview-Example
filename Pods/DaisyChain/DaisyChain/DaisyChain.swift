  /**
   Sequentially performs a view animation using a timing curve corresponding to the motion of a
   physical spring.
   
   - parameter duration:               The total duration of the animations, measured in seconds. If you specify a
                                       negative value or `0`, the changes are made without animating them.
   - parameter delay:                  The amount of time (measured in seconds) to wait before beginning the animations.
                                       Specify a value of `0` to begin the animations immediately.
   - parameter usingSpringWithDamping: The damping ratio for the spring animation as it approaches its quiescent state.
   
                                       To smoothly decelerate the animation without oscillation, use a value of `1`. 
                                       Employ a damping ratio closer to zero to increase oscillation.
   - parameter initialSpringVelocity:  The initial spring velocity. For smooth start to the animation, match this value 
                                       to the view’s velocity as it was prior to attachment.
   
                                       A value of `1` corresponds to the total animation distance traversed in one 
                                       second. For example, if the total animation distance is 200 points and you want 
                                       the start of the animation to match a view velocity of 100 pt/s, use a value of 
                                       `0.5`.
   - parameter options:                A mask of options indicating how you want to perform the animations. For a list 
                                       of valid constants, see `UIViewAnimationOptions`.
   - parameter animations:             A block object containing the changes to commit to the views. This is where you 
                                       programmatically change any animatable properties of the views in your view 
                                       hierarchy. This block takes no parameters and as no return value. This parameter 
                                       must not be `NULL`.
   - parameter completion:             A block object to be executed when the animation sequence ends. This block has no
                                       return value and takes a single Boolean argument that indicates whether or not
                                       the animations actually finished before the completion handler was called. If the
                                       duration of the animation is `0`,this block is performed at the beginning of the
                                       next run loop cycle. This parameter may be `NULL`.
